# On the Hobby of Self-Hosting


 ### Autonomy

To understand the allure of self-hosting one needs to understand the need for autonomy in humans. Is autonomy a whim or preference? It surely comes off as an adaptive trait, whereby if one is stuck in a dangerous situation one could get off through the use of autonomous decisions. Adaptive Evolution, you see. In such the quest for autonomy is a fundamental aspect of our species’ evolutionary trajectory. 

### Big Tech Hegemony

Using everything that the big tech gives us makes us feel like pawns innit? I mean sure, the case for ‘standing on the shoulders of giants’ still stands but what if you could be a ladder at the height of the giant for a second? You could see for yourself the world beyond standing on your feet, technically.

### Craft of Selfhosting

The extreme of any craft merges with procreation. Turing and Christopher? The extreme of any craft indeed merges with procreation, as we've touched on with Turing and Christopher. When you spin out a server from the digital ether, configuring its very essence with your own hands, are you not playing creator? Each line of code, each meticulously chosen setting - they're the DNA of your digital offspring. And like any proud parent, you nurture it, watch it grow, protect it from the harsh realities of the cyber world.

### The Learning Curve

The path of the self-hoster is not for the faint of heart. It's a treacherous climb up the mountain of knowledge, with pitfalls of broken dependencies and chasms of configuration hell. Yet, each stumble teaches, each triumph elevates. You start as a novice, fumbling with your first Raspberry Pi, and before you know it, you're orchestrating a symphony of containers with the finesse of a digital conductor. It's not just about hosting a bloody website anymore - it's about mastering the arcane arts of the internet itself.

### The Tinkerer's Paradise

For the restless minds, the perpetual tinkerers, self-hosting is manna from heaven. It's an endless playground of possibilities, a Lego set with infinite pieces. Today you're tweaking your Nextcloud instance, tomorrow you're setting up a home automation system that would make Tony Stark envious. It's a hobby that grows with you, constantly presenting new challenges, new technologies to master. Boredom? No

### Community and Collaboration

But let's not forget, even in this quest for digital self-reliance, we're not alone. The self-hosting community is a vibrant tapestry of passionate individuals, each on their own journey but united in purpose. Forums buzz with shared knowledge(r/selhosted), GitHub repositories overflow with collaborative efforts. It's a beautiful irony - in seeking independence from big tech, we forge deeper connections with like-minded souls across the globe.

### The Future of Self-Hosting

As we hurtle towards an increasingly digitized future, what becomes of our little rebellion? Will self-hosting remain the domain of the tech-savvy few, or will it evolve into a mainstream movement? As the lines between physical and digital blur, perhaps self-hosting will become as common as growing your own vegetables or generating your own power. A return to digital roots, if you will, in a world drowning in cloud services and AI assistants.
