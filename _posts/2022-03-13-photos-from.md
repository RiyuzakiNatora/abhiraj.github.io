I recently completed my dissertation: ["Mapping crises, communities, and capitalism on OpenStreetMap"](https://twitter.com/aleesteele/status/1486295668465483781). It was a long and bumpy road, and while I'm processing a v2 version (after sending an initial copy out to everyone I spoke to)... I didn't want to lose the forest for the trees, and forget about the whole series of processes and projects that led to this point.

In any case, I thought I would release every paper, project, and presentation I've ever done in graduate school. Because these projects likely won't see the light of day (except for when I forcibly try to drop them in everyday conversation), I thought it would give me a moment to reflect on the sheer amount of work that's been done over the past few years in my little corner of the world.
