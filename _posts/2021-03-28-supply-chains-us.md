over the past few months, my collaborator miriam matthiessen ([@miriammthsn](https://twitter.com/miriammthsn)) and i have been presenting our new collaboration: supply chains and us. while this is supply we'll be building up and revisiting in the coming months, i thought i would log some of our progress here.

[supply-chains.us](supply-chains.us/) was our visual attempt at a digital exhibit. it was our attempt to creatively encapsulate the overwhelming _feeling_ of being in the supply chain, not just the logistical _factual_ nature of it. here are a few screenshots:

we presented at a few conferences this spring, including MozFest, csv,CONF and RightsCon! it was super exciting to get it out into the world, and we really feel like this is only the beginning.
