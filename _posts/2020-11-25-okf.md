hey all!

i recently rounded out the frictionless fellows program at the open knowledge foundation. while i describe the experience more fully in my final post ["endings, beginnings, and reflections"](https://fellows.frictionlessdata.io/blog/anne-final-blog/), i wanted to add a more informal/minimal space here for some of the writing and reflection i did during this time.

the frictionless experience has been endlessly affirming, challenging, and path-altering. for researchers and others who might be considering applying (and who so happen to stumble upon this page), i hope you do!
