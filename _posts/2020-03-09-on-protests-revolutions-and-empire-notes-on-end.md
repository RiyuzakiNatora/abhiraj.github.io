Dear all,

I recently published a piece for The Graduate Press, a student-run publication here at The Graduate Institute, titled "On Protests, Revolutions, and Empire: Notes on America". This was for their Spring 2020 REVOLUTION issue. [You can download a copy of the issue here](https://thegraduatepress.files.wordpress.com/2020/03/tpg-publication-final.pdf).

Always,

A
