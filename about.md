# Abhiraj Mengade

I'm a final year Computer Science undergrad at NITK Suratkal. I am also pursuing a Bachelor's in Data Science from IIT, Madras.

Currently working as a Core Contributor at <a href="https://manexus.xyz/">Manexus</a> and will be joining Oracle as a Member of Technical Staff.

When not at the desk, I generally spend time photographing, travelling, reading or watching movies.

 You can check my photography playbook <a href="https://www.playbook.com/riyuportfolio/d3Gk6hy14dEeS9z4XvJ1qqyu">here</a>, or my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lensing_riyu/">instagram</a>.
