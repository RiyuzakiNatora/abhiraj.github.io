# Abhiraj Mengade

I'm a final year Computer Science undergrad at NITK Suratkal. I am also pursuing a Bachelor's in Data Science from IIT, Madras.

I'm currently working as a Software Consultant at <a href="https://deepforestsci.com/">Deep Forest Sciences</a> and will be joining Oracle as a Member of Technical Staff in July 2024.

When not at the desk, I generally spend time photographing, travelling, reading or watching movies.
